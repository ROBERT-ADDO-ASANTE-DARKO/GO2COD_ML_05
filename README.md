# Weather Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, or rainfall, based on historical weather data. Multiple regression and tree-based models were utilized to achieve accurate predictions.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `forecast.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the entire project pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and prediction.
- `data/`: Directory for storing the weather dataset (if applicable).

## üöÄ Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded and cleaned historical weather data.
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
   - Normalized and scaled features for improved model performance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized trends and relationships in the dataset using heatmaps, scatter plots, and line charts.
   - Explored feature importance and correlations.

3. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Implemented the following models:
     - **Linear Regression**: A basic regression model for prediction.
     - **Decision Trees**: Captures non-linear relationships in the data.
     - **Random Forests**: An ensemble method for enhanced prediction accuracy.
   - **Model Training and Testing**:
     - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
     - Used cross-validation to improve model robustness.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R-squared (R¬≤)

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Optimized models using grid search or manual tuning techniques to enhance performance.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset used includes historical weather data with features such as:
- Date and time
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Precipitation

**Target variable**: Weather parameter to be predicted (e.g., temperature or rainfall).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries
The project utilizes the following Python libraries:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ROBERT-ADDO-ASANTE-DARKO/GO2COD_ML_05.git
   ```
2. Open the `forecast.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or any Python IDE supporting notebooks.
3. Install required libraries directly within the notebook:
   ```python
   !pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially to execute the workflow.

## üìà Model Performance
| Model              | MAE     | R¬≤    |
|--------------------|---------|---------|
| Linear Regression  | 1.20   | 0.96   |
| Decision Tree      | 0.56   | 0.98   |
| Random Forest      | 0.47   | 0.99   |

## üîó Acknowledgments
- Historical weather dataset sourced from [publicly available datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/).
- Thanks to Scikit-learn for providing robust tools for machine learning.
